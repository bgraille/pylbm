pyLBM is an all-in-one package for numerical simulations using Lattice Boltzmann solvers.

This package gives all the tools to describe your lattice Boltzmann scheme in 1D, 2D and 3D problems.

We choose the D'Humi√®res formalism to describe the problem. You can have complex geometry with a set of simple shape like circle, sphere, ...

pyLBM performs the numerical scheme using Cython, Pythran or Numba from the scheme and the domain given by the user. pyLBM has MPI support with mpi4py.

Installation
============

To install pyLBM, you have several ways. You can clone the project

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/gouarin/pylbm
```

and then use the command

```
python setup.py install
```

You can also install the last version on Pypi

```
pip install pyLBM
```
